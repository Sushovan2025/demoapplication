# A C++ program to calculate CGPA and GPA 

As a college student, itâ€™s important to keep track of your academic performance, and one of the key metrics used to measure your progress is your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).


Calculating CGPA can be a time-consuming and complex task, especially if you have taken multiple courses with varying credit load and grading systems. However, with the help of a CGPA calculator, the process can be much simpler and more efficient.
